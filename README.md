## Aloha ðŸ¤™

My name is Jamesbradley Tolentino (also known by Akea), and I am a full stack software engineer with a rich background in customer service. Leveraging 5 years of experience in customer facing roles within the restaurant industry, I aim to carry my communication expertise into the world of tech.

I have always found great satisfaction and fullfilment from solving problems. From when I was four years old and tinkering with Transformers action figures, trying to figure out how to transform them without the help of directions, to my time working as a restaurant manager, staying on top of the day to day curveballs restaurant life can throw at you. Solving not just my problems, but the problems of others is a great joy of mine.

### A little about myself

- I am an App Academy alumni
- Proficient in Javascript and Ruby
- Comfortable working with React/Redux, Rails, and the MERN stack
- I could spend hours at a time playing with styling
